    "```\n",

    "That is, the callable takes zero or more arguments, the circuit result nodes, and optional keyword arguments. The results nodes must be from the same circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter `input_vars` specifies how to determine the function input variables. Default is to use all circuit variables, in index order. Other options are documented in the module `ck.circuit_compiler.support.input_vars`.\n",

    "Parameter `circuit` is rarely needed as each result node keeps track of the circuit it belongs to. However, in some circumstances, when there are no result nodes, the circuit needs to be provided. If the `circuit` parameter is used, then the supplied circuit must be the same as that of the result nodes.\n"
