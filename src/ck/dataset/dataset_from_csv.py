    Interpret the given sequence of lines as CSV for a HardDataset.

    Each line is a list of state indexes (ints) separated by `sep`.

    Every line should have the same number of values.

    If the first line contains a non-integer value, then the first
    line will be interpreted as a header line.

    If there is no header line, then the values will be interpreted in the
    same order as `rvs` and the number of values on each line should be
    the same as the number of random variables in `rvs`.

    If there is a header line, then it will be interpreted as the order
    of random variables. There must be a column name in the header to match
    each name of the given random variables. Additional columns will be ignored.

    Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored for each field, including header column names.

    As text file (and StringIO) objects are iterable over lines, here is how to read a csv file:
    ```
        with open(csv_filename, 'r') as file:
            hard_dataset_from_csv(rvs, file)
    ```
    Here is an example to read from a csv string:
    ```
        hard_dataset_from_csv(rvs, csv_string.splitlines())
    ```

    Args:
        rvs: the random variables for the returned dataset.
        lines: the sequence of lines to interpret, each line is an instance in the dataset.
        weights: the column in the csv file holding instance weights. Can be either the
            column number (counting from zero) or a column name (requires a header line).
        sep: the string to use to separate values in a line, default is a comma.
            If set to `None`, lines will be split on any consecutive run of whitespace characters
            (including \n \r \t \f and spaces).
        comment: text starting with this will be treated as a comment. Set to '' to disallow comments.

    Returns:
        a HardDataset.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the lines do not conform to a CSV format.
