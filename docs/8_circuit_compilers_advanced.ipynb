    "Parameter `circuit` is rarely needed as each result node keeps track of the circuit it belongs to. However, in some circumstances, when there are no result nodes, the circuit needs to be provided. If the `circuit` parameter is used, then the supplied circuit must be the same as that of the result nodes.\n"
