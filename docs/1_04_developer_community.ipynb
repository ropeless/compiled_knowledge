    "\n",
    "A developer installation will normally clone the origin repository. The project source code is available at https://github.com/ropeless/compiled_knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage Python dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository, e.g., using `git clone https://github.com/ropeless/compiled_knowledge.git` or `git clone git@github.com:ropeless/compiled_knowledge.git`.\n",
    "2. Install Python dependencies using poetry: `poetry sync`.\n",
    "   If poetry fails you may need to first run `python -m ensurepip --upgrade` for some versions of Python, to ensure `pip` is operational.\n",
    "3. Build the Cython packages using `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`.\n",
    "4. Optionally: integrate ACE into CK by running `ck.pgm_compiler.ace.copy_ace_to_default_location(ace_dir)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script called `ck_demos/all_demos.py` is available to run most demo scripts in CK (with some exclusions for practical reasons). This can be used as a smoke test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script called `tests/all_test.py` is available to run all unit tests in CK. The script `tests/all_coverage.py` is available to run all unit tests with code coverage analysis.\n",
    "Unit tests are in the package `tests` and are named _something_`_test.py`, where _something_ typically is a direct reference to a `ck` module.\n",
